(Right) State machines & LLM Agent; State machines are the core of the Task Executor, where each state is responsible for one round of interaction with the user. The instruction is provided to the user first with sufficient information for the current decisionmaking step and the required inputs. After receiving the response from the user, it provides output and feedback, where APIs (e.g. program execution/web search/database retrieval) are potentially called during the execution of the state. Afterward, the state machine transits to the next state. LLM Agent generates responses to every step of the state machine on behalf of the user. The user monitors the whole process and provides corrections if the generated content is wrong or overrides the LLM Agent and manually interacts with the Task Executor.",
